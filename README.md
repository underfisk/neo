## About
Neo is a typescript framework which is javascript compatible made for a large scale project but which is very usefull for small ones with the architecture we provide.
Here we do not enforce a specific way of doing the "things", you can simply build your own folder or code structure while we provide interfaces for MVC/MV*.
Using Neo packages, javascript code can be more organized with our multiple patterns implemented. 
Express and Socket.io are underneath being our core modules but also we use other modules to provide more features.
**Warning** Neo is not under development anymore, this framework was made for a project but you are free to use
